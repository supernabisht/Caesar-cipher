# 🔐 Caesar Cipher Encryption Tool

This is a simple **Caesar Cipher** project made in Python 🐍  
It lets you **encode** or **decode** secret messages by shifting letters through the alphabet! 🕵️‍♀️🗝️

---

## 💡 What is a Caesar Cipher?

It's a **substitution cipher** where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places.  
For example, shifting `A` by 3 becomes `D`, and so on 📜➡️🔡

## 💻 How It Works

- Choose whether to encode or decode a message
- Enter your secret message 🕵️
- Select the shift amount (e.g., 3)
- Get the encrypted or decrypted result 💌

---

## 🧠 Key Concepts Used

- Functions & loops
- String manipulation
- User input & validation
- Modular arithmetic
- ASCII & character shifting 🔢

---

## 📸 Sample Output

```text
Type 'encode' to encrypt, type 'decode' to decrypt:
> encode
Type your message:
> sana is coding
Type the shift number:
> 5
Here's the encoded result: xfsf nx htiins
